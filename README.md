# guess-it-game
GitHub Guess It is a number guessing game created as a Python project that can be run on any computer. The game is designed to be played in the command line interface. The objective of the game is to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within a certain number of chances, based on the chosen difficulty level. The game has two difficulty levels, easy and hard, with easy mode giving the player ten chances to guess the correct number, while hard mode only gives five chances.

The game uses the random module to generate a random number between 1 and 100. The player's input is then checked against the random number, and the game responds with "too high" or "too low" if the player's guess is higher or lower than the number respectively. If the player does not guess the number within the specified number of chances, they lose the game.

The game also includes error handling to prevent the player from inputting non-integer values or invalid inputs. It also prompts the player to play again at the end of the game. The game is stored in a GitHub repository, allowing other developers to view, collaborate, and make contributions to the code.

In summary, GitHub Guess It is a command line-based game that challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of chances. With error handling, multiple difficulty levels, and a collaborative environment, it provides an engaging and educational way for beginner programmers to learn and improve their coding skills.
